## How to build a capability?

To begin developing a new capability, create a folder and name it according to your capability.

### File Structure

The capability folder should contain the following file `main.py`.

This file contains the necessary classes and functions to set up your capability. Implement your capability logic within this file.

```python
class YourCapability(MatchingCapability):
    @classmethod
    def register_capability(cls) -> "MatchingCapability":
        return cls(
            unique_name="unique capability name, e.g., timer",
            matching_hotwords=["write words to trigger capability, e.g., 'set a timer for ten minutes'"],
        )

    def call(
        self,
        msg: str,
        agent: BotAgent,
        text_respond: SynchronousTTT,
        speak_respond: None,
        audio: str,
        worker: AgentWorker,
        meta: dict[str, Any],
        interrupt_str: SharedValue,
    ):
        # Write your capability code here
        return "Your Capability Called!"
```

### Registering Capability

In the `register_capability` method of `main.py`, specify the details of your capability:

- `unique_name`: Name of your capability.
- `matching_hotwords`: List of keywords to trigger the capability.

### Call Function

The `call` function is invoked when the capability is triggered. This is where your capability logic resides. The returned string will be played with the agent's voice.

### CapabilityWorker

If you need to develop a capability capable of pausing the main loop, you can use CapabilityWorker. CapabilityWorker is initialized with a worker and is utilized for speech and listening functionalities.

**Publishing a Capability**: If you've finalized your capability and wish to make it public follow these steps:

1. **Compress Capability Folder:**
   - Compress the folder containing your capability files, including `main.py` and any other necessary files, into a zip file.

2. **Upload to OpenHome Dashboard:**
   - Head over to the OpenHome [Dashboard](https://app.openhome.xyz/add_capability).
   - Enter the name of the capability.
   - Provide a description of what the capability does.
   - Upload an icon to represent the capability.
   - Upload the zip file containing your capability folder.
   - Add words or phrases that will trigger this capability.
   - Click Submit to add the new capability.
