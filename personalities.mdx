At the heart of the OpenHome ecosystem are **Personalities**—customizable AI voice characters or agents designed for specific tasks and applications. Each Personality is characterized by several key attributes, including:

- **Description and Purpose**: Defines the Personality’s role and how it behaves within the chosen LLM.

- **Voice**: You can tailor the voice to best represent the Personality, aligning with your preferences or project needs.

- **Dynamic Feedback**: Personalities evolve based on user interactions, learning from conversations to provide more personalized responses over time. OpenHome's **DynamicPersonalityConstructor** enables Personalities to evolve with every conversation. They adapt to your conversation history, preferences, and personal style, creating an ever-improving interaction experience. This ensures that the conversation isn’t just accurate but also deeply personalized, making every interaction feel more intuitive.

### How Personalities Work

The core architecture revolves around three key modules: **STT Transcription** (Speech-to-Text), **TTT Processing** (Text-to-Text), and **Voice TTS** (Text-to-Speech). These modules work together to create rich, adaptive experiences powered by customizable "Personalities".

#### Workflow

1. **Speech Input:** The system listens for voice commands, initiated by a cold start message.
2. **STT Transcription:** The Speech-to-Text (STT) module converts speech into text.
3. **LLM Processing:** The transcribed text is processed by the designated LLM (the “brains” of the assistant, the large language model), which generates a relevant response based on the user's input and conversation history. OpenHome supports over 20 different LLMs.
4. **TTS Synthesis:** Once a response is generated, it’s converted back into speech using customizable voices, creating a natural, interactive experience. This module brings the conversation to life with fluent, human-like speech.

## How to Create & Manage Personalities 

The **Personalities dashboard** allows you to view, manage, and create custom AI Personalities. You can also customize the interaction experience by adding new voices.

### Creating New Personality

To get started, visit the Personalities dashboard, and select the <img src="openhome_icons/dashboard_images/add_new_personality_button.png" alt="Create Button" width="100" height="30" style={{ display: 'inline-block', marginRight: '8px', verticalAlign: 'middle' }} /> button at the top right of the page and input the following information:

- **Name**: Enter the name of your Personality (We suggest something unique and identifiable). This is the name that will be used to identify your Personality in the dashboard and marketplace (optional). Note that your Personality will be aware of this name as an identifier.

- **Personality Image**: Upload an image to represent this Personality. This image will be used in the marketplace to represent your Personality.

- **Cold Start Message**: Personalities can optionally be configured with an opening message or greeting. This first message will be spoken by your Personality when you first start a new conversation. Certain use cases require a first message, while others do not.

- **Description**: The description serves as the first System Prompt for your Personality. It is the first prompt in the message list fed to the LLM, and it sets the foundation for how the Personality behaves. Use the description to define the context, role, personality traits, and specific instructions, shaping the way the Personality responds and interacts. 

- **Purpose**: Specify the Personality’s intended role or function, further refining your description. By adding additional context, you help the LLM understand the job or role associated with the Personality, ensuring it behaves in a more accurate and relevant way based on its function.

- **Voice ID**: Select a voice from the list to determine how the Personality will sound. Use a pre-installed voice or add your own Voice ID.

### Uploading Your Voice

- **Generating a Voice ID**: Before adding a new voice in OpenHome, you’ll need to upload your custom voice to your preferred TTS provider (e.g., Eleven Labs). Once uploaded, you’ll receive a Voice ID from the provider, which you can enter in the Voice ID field here.
- **Updating API Key**: Ensure your API key for the TTS provider is up to date. This key is necessary for OpenHome to communicate with the TTS service and use your custom voice for Personalities. You can update or manage your API key in the **API Keys settings** section.
