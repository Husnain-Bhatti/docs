# Abilities

## Introduction to Abilities

Abilities are modular extensions that enhance the functionality of your OpenHome Personalities. They act as plugins, enabling your Personalities to perform specialized tasks, such as fetching data from the web, controlling smart devices, or executing complex commands tailored to your project's requirements.

With Abilities, you can:
- Add **Trigger Words** to define specific phrases or commands that activate a particular Ability.
- Use the **Marketplace** to explore and install community-created Abilities.
- Customize or create your own Abilities through the **Live Editor** or by uploading pre-built code.
