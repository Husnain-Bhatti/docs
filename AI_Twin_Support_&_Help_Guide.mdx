Welcome to the support hub for AI Twin by OpenHome — your creative space to build a voice-powered version of yourself. Below you'll find helpful information for getting started, managing your Twin, and troubleshooting common issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I make my AI Twin?
It's easy. Just launch the app and follow the guided creation process. You'll answer a few voice and personality questions — and we'll automatically generate your Twin's voice, background, and bio based on your answers.

### Do I need to create an account?
Yes. Once you've built your AI Twin, make sure to create an account or log in to save your progress. If you skip this step, your Twin may be lost.

### Can I edit my AI Twin later?
Definitely. After you log in, go to your Settings page. From there, you can update your Twin's:
- Twin Bio
- Twin Background
- Username

## Basic Troubleshooting

### Problem: I lost my AI Twin
Make sure you were logged in when building your Twin. If not, you'll need to rebuild it. Always log in to save. If you're not logged in, close and open the app to restart the Twin building process should you get stuck.

### Problem: Audio recording isn't working
Check your phone's microphone permissions in your device settings. Make sure the AI Twin app is allowed to access your mic. Be in a quiet environment and speak clearly when answering questions.

Try closing and restarting the app. If the issue continues, delete and reinstall or update the app from your app store.
