title: How to Build an Ability 
description: Learn to build and integrate custom Abilities in OpenHome, using `CapabilityWorker` and example use cases.

---

## Introduction

Custom Abilities are the cornerstone of extending OpenHome's functionality. They allow developers to:

- Add personalized features to AI agents.
- Integrate third-party APIs for dynamic interactions.
- Customize logic for enhanced user engagement.

This guide walks you through:

- Structuring and registering an Ability.
- Using `CapabilityWorker` for seamless I/O management.
- Examples showcasing how to create powerful custom Abilities.

## Adding an Ability

### File Structure

Each Ability resides in its folder and requires a `main.py` file to define the logic.

```plaintext
<YourAbilityFolder>
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

### Example File: `main.py`

Hereâ€™s a basic template for building a new Ability:

```python
class YourCapability(MatchingCapability):
    @classmethod
    def register_capability(cls) -> "MatchingCapability":
        return cls(
            unique_name="unique capability name, e.g., timer",
            matching_hotwords=["words to trigger, e.g., 'set a timer for ten minutes'"],
        )

    def call(
        self,
        msg: str,
        agent: BotAgent,
        text_respond: SynchronousTTT,
        speak_respond: None,
        audio: str,
        worker: AgentWorker,
        meta: dict[str, Any],
        agent_current_message: SharedValue,
    ):
        # Your capability logic here
        return "Your Capability Called!"
```

### Key Components

- **`register_capability`**: Defines the Ability's `unique_name` and `matching_hotwords`.  
- **`call`**: Executes the Abilityâ€™s logic when triggered.

---

## Understanding `CapabilityWorker`

The `CapabilityWorker` class simplifies I/O interactions, enabling:

- **Speech synthesis**: Using text-to-speech (TTS).  
- **Listening for user input**: Capturing and processing responses.  
- **Running interaction loops**: Supporting conversational flows.

---

### Speak Function

The `speak` function converts text into speech and streams it to the user via WebSocket.

```python
async def speak(self, tokens: str, agent_current_message: SharedValue):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        websocket: ClientWebSocketResponse = await self.tts_ios.session.ws_connect(
            url=self.worker.tts_ios.stream_uri,
            headers=self.worker.tts_ios.headers,
        )
        await self.worker.speak(websocket, tokens, agent_current_message)
```

### User Response Function

This function listens for user input asynchronously, ideal for capturing dynamic user responses.

```python
async def user_response(self):
    while not self.worker.user_is_finished_speak_event.is_set():
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
    user_input = await self.worker.context_queue.get()
    return user_input
```

### Run I/O Loop

The `run_io_loop` orchestrates speaking and listening for responses in a single flow.

```python
async def run_io_loop(self, tokens: str, agent_current_message: SharedValue):
    await self.speak(tokens, agent_current_message)
    result = await self.user_response()
    return result
```

### Confirmation Loop

This specialized loop handles confirmation prompts like "yes" or "no" interactions.

```python
async def run_confirmation_loop(self, tokens: str, agent_current_message: SharedValue):
    prompt = tokens + ", Please respond with 'yes' or 'no'."
    while True:
        await self.speak(prompt, agent_current_message)
        response = await self.user_response()
        if "yes" in response.lower():
            return True
        elif "no" in response.lower():
            return False
```

## Example 1: Basic Capability

This Ability creates a daily life advisor that:

1. **Asks the user for a problem**: Initiates a conversation to gather user input.  
2. **Provides advice**: Offers a solution based on user input.  
3. **Collects feedback**: Captures user satisfaction with the advice.

---

### Code

```python
class BasicCapability(MatchingCapability):
    async def give_advice(self):
        await self.capability_worker.speak("Hi! I'm your daily life advisor. Tell me your problem.")
        user_problem = await self.capability_worker.user_response()

        solution_prompt = f"Provide a solution for: {user_problem}"
        solution = self.capability_worker.text_to_text_response(solution_prompt)

        user_feedback = await self.capability_worker.run_io_loop(
            solution + " Are you satisfied with the advice?"
        )
        await self.capability_worker.speak("Thank you for using the advisor.")
        self.capability_worker.resume_normal_flow()

    def call(self, worker: AgentWorker):
        self.worker = worker
        self.capability_worker = CapabilityWorker(self.worker)
        asyncio.create_task(self.give_advice())
```
### Key Functions

- **`speak`**: Introduces the advisor and provides the solution.  
- **`user_response`**: Captures user input (e.g., their problem).  
- **`run_io_loop`**: Combines speaking the solution and listening for feedback.  
- **`resume_normal_flow`**: Resumes the agent's default workflow after interaction.

## Example 2: Weather Capability

This Ability integrates a weather API to fetch and share weather updates based on user-provided locations.

---

### Code

```python
class WeatherDocsCapability(MatchingCapability):
    async def first_setup(self, location: str):
        if not location:
            await self.capability_worker.speak("Which location?")
            location = await self.capability_worker.user_response()

        geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="weather_agent")
        loc = geolocator.geocode(location)

        if loc:
            result = requests.get(
                f"https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude={loc.latitude}&longitude={loc.longitude}&current=temperature_2m"
            ).json()
            weather_report = f"The temperature in {location} is {result['current']['temperature_2m']}Â°C."
            await self.capability_worker.speak(weather_report)
        else:
            await self.capability_worker.speak("Invalid location. Try again.")
        
        self.capability_worker.resume_normal_flow()

    def call(self, worker: AgentWorker):
        self.worker = worker
        self.capability_worker = CapabilityWorker(self.worker)
        asyncio.create_task(self.first_setup(""))
```

### Key Features

- **External API Call**: Fetches real-time weather data.  
- **Geolocation**: Validates and processes user-provided locations.  
- **Error Handling**: Provides meaningful feedback for invalid inputs.
